# Add target

To register a new target in DAIKON, the Target Promotion Questionnaire must be completed. It is a structured tool to evaluate and document the rationale for advancing a gene (protein) or a set of genes (protein complex) as a potential therapeutic target.

2. The Target Promotion Questionnaire captures evidence across multiple domains and each section consists of targeted questions designed to support a data-driven decision-making process.
Each question within the questionnaire typically includes:
- A specific question relevant to the target's therapeutic potential
- A set of predefined answers representing different levels of evidence or understanding

4.After a target has been approved, it appears in the Targets table. This table provides a consolidated view of all proposed targets and their key attributes, enabling quick comparison. 
- The target table includes information such as associated Genes, and some evidence-based scores
(a set of scores derived from the questionnaire responses or other curated data sources). 
- The table supports sorting and filtering functionalities to help users identify high-priority entries or locate specific targets.
- In addition, all targets are plotted in an interactive visualization graph, that offers a high-level overview of all targets, and helps identify promising candidates across the portfolio.
