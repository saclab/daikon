# Portfolio Module Structure

The Portfolio module in DAIKON is organized into two tabs:

<h3>1. Portfolio Dashboard - Overview:</h3>
The Dashboard provides a high-level, visual summary of the portfolio landscape. 
<br />
<br />

- It is categorized into 4 status cards, and each card reflects the current phase of a project in the drug discovery pipeline.
- Ready for Portfolio : Indicates projects that have completed Hit Assessment (HA) and are now eligible to enter the portfolio.
- H2L (Hit-to-Lead) : Projects actively undergoing Hit-to-Lead optimization, where structural improvements and SAR are being explored.
- LO (Lead Optimization) : Represents mature hit series advancing through deeper optimization.
- SP (Selection for Progression) : Projects that are nearing or undergoing clinical candidate nomination.

At the top of each stage column, you’ll see a count in the format A/B:

A = Number of active projects in that stage<br />
B = Total projects in that stage (active + terminated)<br />
For e.g: H2L – 8/77 (8 active H2L projects out of 77 total H2L projects)

Each status card provides a quick summary of key information:

- Portfolio name: The name of the drug discovery project.
- Primary Organization: The lead institution or group managing the project.
- Associated Target Name: The target tied to the project. If the HA is phenotypic, this field will display "Unknown".
- Primary Structure: The key chemical structure or representative compound for the project.
- Dates (Left and Right): The left date is the Actual Start Date of the current stage, and the right date is the Predicted Start Date of the next stage. For example: In the LO stage, left date = LO Actual Start Date, right date = SP Predicted Start Date

<h3>2. All Portfolio Projects - Tabular view:</h3>
The Tabular View provides a comprehensive and interactive listing of all portfolio projects. It is designed for efficient tracking, searching, and filtering of drug discovery programs at various stages.

- Project Name
- Primary Organization
- Status : Current state of the project (e.g., Active, Removed).
- Stage : The current phase of the project (e.g., Ready for Portfolio, H2L, LO, SP).
- Predicted Date: Estimated milestone or transition date for the current stage.
