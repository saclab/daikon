# Post-Portfolio Module Structure

The Post-Portfolio module in DAIKON is organized into two tabs, identical to the Portfolio section:

<h3>1. Post-Portfolio Dashboard - Overview:</h3>
The Dashboard provides a high-level, visual summary of the post-portfolio landscape. 
<br />
<br />

- It is categorized into 2 status cards, and each card reflects the current phase of a project in the drug discovery pipeline.
- IND : Indicates projects that have completed SP stage and are now eligible to enter the post-portfolio.
- P1 : Projects undergoing the first stage of clinical testing in human subjects..

At the top of each stage column, youâ€™ll see a count in the format A/B:

A = Number of active projects in that stage<br />
B = Total projects in that stage (active + terminated)<br />

Each status card provides a quick summary of key information:

- Post-Portfolio name: The name of the drug discovery project.
- Primary Organization: The lead institution or group managing the project.
- Associated Target Name: The target tied to the project. If the HA is phenotypic, this field will display "Unknown".
- Primary Structure: The key chemical structure or representative compound for the project.
- Dates (Left and Right): The left date is the Actual Start Date of the current stage, and the right date is the Predicted Start Date of the next stage. 

<h3>2. All Post-Portfolio Projects - Tabular view:</h3>
The Tabular View provides a comprehensive and interactive listing of all post-portfolio projects. It is designed for efficient tracking, searching, and filtering of drug discovery programs at various stages.
