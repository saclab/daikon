# Accessing the Horizon View

In addition to capturing individual drug discovery data points, DAIKON offers a visual summary of progress for each target and project through the Horizon View, a feature applicable across all stages of the pipeline. This view is structured as a horizontal tree, with the selected gene as the root node. Each branch represents the gene’s progression through different stages, providing an intuitive overview of its journey from initial screening to later development milestones. 

- Click the ☰ icon on the right side of the title bar at any stage to open the Horizon View.
