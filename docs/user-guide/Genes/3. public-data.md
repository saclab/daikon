# Public Data and Structures

The Gene Detail view provides a wealth of information about individual genes, including public data that is available for each gene. Public data is sourced from UniProt, MycoBrowser, and PDB. UniProt and PDB data are retrieved in real time, while MycoBrowser data was obtained a a year ago. This information can be essential for drug discovery researchers to gain a better understanding of potential drug targets. The Gene Detail view displays various pieces of data related to a particular gene, including a Protein Summary, Orthologs, Coordinates,GO Annotations, Genomic Sequence, and Protein Sequence.

One particularly important piece of data that is available in the Gene Detail view is protein structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), which includes detailed three-dimensional models of proteins. These protein structures can provide valuable insights into the structure-function relationships of the gene's protein product, which can be useful in drug discovery. Additionally, the PDB data can include information on ligands that bind to the protein, which can provide important information for drug development. DAIKON embeds the LiteMol Viewer.


**To view a protein structure** in DAIKON, navigate to the "Protein Databank" section and click on one of the entries listed. This will bring up a detailed view of the selected structure.

If you want to download a PDB report for the selected structure, simply click on the sub-menu of the "View Structure" button. From here, you can choose to download the report.
