<h4>1. Nomenclature</h4>
The Nomenclature form is the first step in creating a new Hit Assessment. It captures key identifiers and metadata for the project.
Fields include:

- Project Name - Give your project a clear and meaningful name that reflects its purpose or objective. A good name will make it easier to identify the project later.
- Description - Provide a brief explanation of the project's goal or scope.
- Primary Organization - Lead organization responsible for the project.
- Participating Organizations - Include any other organizations collaborating on the project.
- Status (e.g., Ready, Active, Inactive, Complete) - Definitions for each status are shown in the [Overview](ha-module-structure) tab for reference.

- Click Next to proceed to add more information.

<h4>2. Compound</h4>
A HA is typically linked to a specific screen, most often through a primary compound and a related set of compounds from the screen’s hit list.
On this page, there are three ways to proceed:


- Start with a Screen: Select an existing screen to automatically retrieve its associated hit list and nominate a primary compound.
- Start with a Compound: Manually enter a specific compound (e.g., via SMILES or Compound ID) and associate it with the appropriate screen.
- Undisclosed Compound: Proceed without revealing the compound structure. This option is intended for assessments involving confidential or unregistered compounds.
  - ⚠️  Note: If the compound originates from a screen, it should first be added as an undisclosed entry in the Screen section before proceeding.
