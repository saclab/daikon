<h4>1. Nomenclature</h4>
The Nomenclature form is the first step in creating a new Hit Assessment. It captures key identifiers and metadata for the project.
Fields include:

- Project Name - Give your project a clear and meaningful name that reflects its purpose or objective. A good name will make it easier to identify the project later.
- Description - Provide a brief explanation of the project's goal or scope.
- Primary Organization - Lead organization responsible for the project.
- Participating Organizations - Include any other organizations collaborating on the project.
- Status (e.g., Ready, Active, Inactive, Complete) - Definitions for each status are shown in the [Overview](ha-module-structure) tab for reference.

- Click Next to proceed to add more information.

<h4>2. Compound</h4>

In some cases, a Hit Assessment may need to be created for a compound whose structure is confidential or not yet registered in MolecuLogix. This option allows assessments to move forward while preserving compound confidentiality.

- Start with Undisclosed Compound

- A warning is displayed to the user. This means you will proceed without linking a specific compound or a screen/hit list to your Hit Assessment.
While this is valid, please note the following:

üîç We recommend linking a compound whenever possible to maintain an interactive, searchable workflow within Daikon.

üîç If this Hit Assessment is based on a screen that has not yet been created, please create the screen first.

üîç If the compound is undisclosed or unknown, and there is no associated screen, you may proceed without linking a compound.

- Click on 'Acknowledge & Continue' to move forward with an undisclosed Hit Assessment.
