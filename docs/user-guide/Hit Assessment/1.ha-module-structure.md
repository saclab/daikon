<h3>Overview</h3>
This is the default landing page when entering the Hit Assessment module. It provides a high-level summary of all HAs categorized by their current status:

  - Ready for HA – Hit series identified as suitable to begin assessment
  - Active – Ongoing hit assessments currently being evaluated
  - Inactive – Hit Assessments that have been deprioritized due to specific issues such as incorrect mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), known structural liabilities, failure to complete the assessment process or lack of confirmed activity
  - Complete – HAs that have been finalized with a decision or conclusion

Each status card provides a quick summary of key information:
- Project Name - Name of the associated drug discovery project
- Primary Organization - The lead institution or group responsible
- Associated Target Name - If the HA is phenotypic, this field will display "Unknown"
- Primary Structure – The representative compound or hit structure
- Last Status Modified Date – Timestamp of the most recent status update

This view offers quick visibility into the overall HA portfolio and serves as a starting point for initiating or resuming assessments.


<h3>Paused HA</h3> 
This section lists all HAs that have been paused. This helps track deprioritized efforts or deferred assessments for future review.

<h3>All HA Projects</h3>

This view displays a full list of all HAs, past and present, regardless of status. 
Each entry typically includes Project name, Primary organization, Status.
