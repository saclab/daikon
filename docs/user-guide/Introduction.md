# Introduction

The drug discovery process involves several stages, each with a distinct set of activities and data requirements. To effectively manage this complex pipeline, DAIKON has been designed with an **_orthogonal approach_** that organizes the different stages along the horizontal axis and presents the information at each stage in a vertical arrangement.

<h3>DAIKON landing page</h3>

The DAIKON landing page provides users with a high-level overview of platform activity and updates, helping teams stay informed and aligned.
The horizontal axis of the tool represents the different stages of the drug discovery process, which includes **Gene** identification, **Target** validation, **Screening**, **Hit Assessment**, **Portfolio** selection, and **Post-portfolio** analysis. By positioning each stage along the horizontal axis, the tool provides a clear and concise overview of the entire pipeline.

In addition, the vertical arrangement of information within each stage allows users to adjust the level of granularity presented at each stage of the process. The tool starts with a high-level overview of each stage, providing users with a broad understanding of the activities and data requirements. As the user progresses through each stage, the level of detail increases, allowing users to drill down into more specific data and information.

This approach enables users to have a more structured and organized view of the drug discovery process, and facilitates effective decision-making by ensuring that all relevant information is presented in a clear and concise manner. By providing a comprehensive view of the drug discovery pipeline, the tool allows users to identify bottlenecks, prioritize activities, and optimize resource allocation, ultimately leading to more efficient drug discovery and development.

<h4>What's New</h4>

This section highlights new features and upcoming enhancements in every release. It gives users a quick snapshot of recent improvements and what's planned next, so theyâ€™re always up to date on the evolving capabilities of DAIKON.

<h4>Activity Feed</h4>

The central panel displays a live activity feed, showing who performed the activity, what the activity was (such as status updates, edits, or comments), when it occurred, and which stage or module it relates to (for example, H2L, SP, or Screening). This real-time feed helps users track progress and team actions across projects.

<h4>Latest Discussions</h4>

The discussions panel showcases the latest conversations happening within the platform. These discussions include comments, questions, and collaborative exchanges among team members, often linked to specific tags for easy identification and context.

<h4>MolecuLogix Interface</h4>

On the DAIKON landing page, there is also a direct shortcut to the MolecuLogix interface, providing quick access to compound browsing, SAR analysis, and related molecular data tools. 

<h4>Publications</h4>

It includes a link which directs users to the official publication of DAIKON. This allows users to reference DAIKON appropriately in presentations, reports, or academic work.
