    "description": "Screens refer to the experimental process of identifying compounds of interest through assays against a biological target or system. DAIKON stores target-based and phenotypic screening information in the Screen component. Both approaches aim to uncover starting points for drug discovery efforts, with target-based screens offering mechanistic precision and phenotypic screens capturing complex, system-level effects."
