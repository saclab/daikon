# Add a screen

<h3>Add a target-based screen </h3>
In target-based screens, compounds are tested for their ability to modulate the activity of a specific, predefined molecular target believed to play a key role in disease. Tracking ongoing target screening efforts helps in maintaining an internal screen repository. To demonstrate ongoing effort, you can record the screen hit count associated with every run, and structure detail can be added at any point. The records can be exported as a csv file.

1. Go to Screens, and click on "Add a Screen" in the upper right corner

<br />
2. Select Target Based and populate the form: included Name of the screen, Screening organization, Method, Status, Expected Start and Completion Dates, and additional Notes if any. 

- The Target Name is generated automatically by the app from the list of promoted targets 
- The Name should describe what type of screen was performed 
- Screening organization is where the screen is taking place 
- Method is the screening technique used such as Biochemical, DNA encoded Del, Fragment, Hypomorph, Virtual, or Other.<br />

<h3>Add a phenotypic screen </h3>

Phenotypic screens assess the impact of compounds on a broader biological outcome or phenotype, such as cell survival or morphology, without prior knowledge of the specific molecular target. Tracking ongoing phenotypic screening efforts helps in maintaining an internal screen repository. To demonstrate ongoing effort, you can record the screen hit count associated with every run, and structure detail can be added at any point. The records can be exported as a csv file. 

1. Go to Screens, and click on "Add a Screen" in the upper right corner

<br />
2. Select Phenotypic and populate the form including: Name of the screen, Screening Organization, Status, Expected Start and Completion Dates, and additional Notes if any.  

- The Name should describe what type of screen was performed (e.g. strain, carbon source, duration, readout method, additives, and/or special conditions like hypoxia or low pH).
- Screening organization is where the screen is taking place
