# Screen Module Structure

The screening module in DAIKON is organized into three main tabs :

<h3>1. Overview</h3>
This is the default landing page when entering the Screens module. It provides a high-level summary of all Screens categorized by their current status, and separated into the Target Based and Phenotypic swim lanes:

- Planned | Assay Development: A screening assay is planned or under development, but has not yet been initiated 
- Ongoing: One or more libraries are being actively run through the screening assay 
- Voting Ready: Hits that arise from screening assays have been identified and are ready for initial voting assessment from MedChem team members 
- Recently Completed: Screen hits have been identified and are ready for further Hit Assessment activities

Each status card provides a quick summary of key information: 

- Type of screening: Either phenotypic, or the type of Target-based screen (DEL, affinity, virtual screen, etc.) 
- Primary Organization: The lead institution or group responsible for conducting the screen 
- Last Status Modified Date: Timestamp of the most recent status update 
- Status clock: Indicates how long since a screen has been updated 
- The Orange clock indicates that it has been >3months since the screen was updated 
- The Red clock indicates that is has been >6months since the screen was updated 
- Screen Name: Name of Target being screened, or a high-level overview of the phenotypic screening conditions (e.g. strain, carbon source, duration, readout method, additives, and/or special conditions like hypoxia or low pH) 

This view offers quick visibility into all screening activities within the pre-portfolio and serves as a starting point for updating screening data. <br />

There is an All Screens/ Hiding Paused Screens toggle that will hide/unhide screens with the red status clock indicator. You can sort this view by a selected Target, Organization or Method. 

<h3>2. Target based</h3>

This section lists all target-based screens that have been entered in DAIKON. This helps track historical efforts and inactive screening activities for full transparency and avoidance of duplication of effort. Target-based screens can be sorted by Name, Target, Method, Primary Org or Status.

<h3>3. Phenotypic</h3>

This section lists all phenotypic screens that have been entered in DAIKON. This helps track historical efforts and inactive screening activities for full transparency. Target-based screens can be sorted by Name, Primary Org, Status, or Notes
