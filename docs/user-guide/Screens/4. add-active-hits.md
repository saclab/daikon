# Add Active Hits

Confirmed active hits from screens should be captured in DAIKON. A voting mechanism allows chemists to rate these compounds and prioritize the high-quality hits to proceed to the next phase of Hit Assessment.  

To begin adding hits to a screen:

1. Navigate to the Hits tab within the selected screen, and click on + Add Hit Collection or + Create a Hit Collection.

A Hit Collection is a group of compounds that have shown potential in preliminary screens.
A single screen can have multiple hit collections, which can be organized based on any specific criteria. Once the collection is created, you can start adding individual compounds to it

2. Add information for the following fields, then click ‘Add to Database’:
-  Hit Collection Type: Required dropdown field with options such as Confirmed Active, Disclosed Hits, Others, etc. This helps categorize the collection based on the nature of the hits.
- Name: Required field to provide a unique and descriptive name for the hit collection.
- Notes: Optional text field to capture any additional context or relevant details about the collection.
