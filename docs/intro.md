# An Introduction

DAIKON is a framework developed for pharmaâ€“academic consortium-based drug discovery efforts to share ideas, technologies, compounds, assays, projects and portfolios.

In the field of drug discovery, developing new therapeutic agents is a complex and time-consuming process that requires significant resources, expertise, and collaboration. To support the drug discovery process, a comprehensive knowledge capture and project management tool can be an invaluable asset. This tool can help researchers capture and organize important scientific data, streamline communication and collaboration, and manage the workflow from early-stage drug discovery through clinical development.

The drug discovery knowledge capture and project management tool provides a centralized platform that enables researchers to track and analyze data, plan and execute experiments, and collaborate with team members. This tool allows researchers to capture and store data in a structured and organized way, making it easier to search and retrieve information when needed. Additionally, the project management features help keep everyone on the same page and on track towards achieving project milestones and goals.

The tool can help speed up the drug discovery process and reduce the risk of errors or oversights. It also helps to ensure that research teams are working together efficiently, resulting in more successful drug discovery outcomes. With the right drug discovery knowledge capture and project management tool, researchers can accelerate the development of new therapeutic agents, and ultimately, improve patient outcomes.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.
- [DotNetCore](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
  - Version 6.0 is recommended.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or preferred code editor.

## Getting Started

Start by cloning daikon-core-server and daikon-core-webapp\*\*.

Daikon uses docker that simplifies software deployment by packaging applications and their dependencies into portable containers that can be easily deployed across different environments. This helps eliminate compatibility issues and allows for faster and more efficient deployment of software

## Follow our qucik start guides

Guides to start the project are under **"Deployment Guide"** section
